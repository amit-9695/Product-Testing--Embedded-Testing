Anonymous Functions:
========================
|-Sometimes we can declare a function without any name,such type of nameless functions are called anonymous   functions or lambda functions.

|-The main purpose of anonymous function is just for instant use(i.e for one time usage)Normal Function:

|-We can define by using def keyword.

def squareIt(n):
 return n*n

lambda Function:
===================

|-We can define by using lambda keyword
	lambda n:n*n

Syntax of lambda Function:
===============================
	lambda argument_list : expression

Note: By using Lambda Functions we can write very concise code so that readability of the program will be improved.


Q. Write a program to create a lambda function to find square of given 

s=lambda n:n*n 
print("The Square of 4 is :",s(4)) 
print("The Square of 5 is :",s(5)) 

Output
The Square of 4 is : 16 
The Square of 5 is : 25

Q. Lambda function to find sum of 2 given numbers
s=lambda a,b:a+b 
print("The Sum of 10,20 is:",s(10,20)) 
print("The Sum of 100,200 is:",s(100,200)) 

Output
The Sum of 10,20 is: 30 
The Sum of 100,200 is: 300


Q. Lambda Function to find biggest of given values.
s=lambda a,b:a if a>b else b 
print("The Biggest of 10,20 is:",s(10,20)) 
print("The Biggest of 100,200 is:",s(100,200)) 
 
 Output
The Biggest of 10,20 is: 20 
 The Biggest of 100,200 is: 200 

Note:
|-Lambda Function internally returns expression value and we are not required to write return statement   explicitly.

Note: Sometimes we can pass function as argument to another function. In such cases 
lambda functions are best choice


Exercies:

1. Write a  Python program to create a lambda function that adds 15 to a given number passed in as an argument,    also create a lambda function that multiplies argument x with argument y and prints the result.

Sample Output:
25
48

2. Write a  Python program to create a function that takes one argument, and that argument will be multiplied    with an unknown given number.

Sample Output:
Double the number of 15 = 30
Triple the number of 15 = 45
Quadruple the number of 15 = 60
Quintuple the number 15 = 75


3.Write a  Python program to square and cube every number in a given list of integers using Lambda.

Original list of integers:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Square every number of the said list:
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
Cube every number of the said list:
[1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000]


4.Write a  Python program to find if a given string starts with a given character using Lambda.
Sample Output:
True
False

The power of six for number 3 = 18
The power of seven for number 3 = 21

7. Write a python program to generate a lambda function to check whether a given string is a number or not. (True or False)

The output is:

Example of Expected Answer:
Is the given 3687 a number: True
Is the given Python a number: False
