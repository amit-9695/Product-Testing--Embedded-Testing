Problem-1

Write a Python program to validate whether a given string is a valid variable name according to Python naming conventions. 

The program will prompt the user to enter a string, and then it will validate the string based on the following rules:
The string must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
The string can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_) after the first character.
The string must not be a reserved keyword in Python.


Problem-2

It should contain at least one lowercase letter.
It should contain at least one digit.
It should contain at least one special character from the set [!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>].


Problem-3
Gautham is preparing a unique number sequence to help in a coding challenge for beginners he wants to create series of triangular pattern. The challenge is to create a triangular pattern using sequences of natural numbers up to n, but only for odd row numbers, using the continue statement.

Gautham's task is to print the triangular pattern for each odd number starting from 1 up to n.
