========================================
|-The root directory / is the top of the hierarchy, and everything stems from it.

üìÅ Top-Level Directories:

Directory				Description
/				Root directory ‚Äî the starting point of the filesystem
/bin				Essential user binaries (commands like ls, cp, mv, rm, etc.)
/sbin				System binaries (like reboot, fdisk, used by root)
/etc				Configuration files for the system
/dev				Device files (like /dev/sda for disks, /dev/null, etc.)
/proc				Virtual filesystem for process and system info (like /proc/cpuinfo)
/var				Variable files like logs, mail, spool files
/tmp				Temporary files, cleared on reboot
/usr				User-installed software, libraries, and documentation
/home				Home directories of all users (e.g., /home/alice)
/root				Home directory of the root user
/boot				Boot loader files (like vmlinuz, initrd.img)
/lib, /lib64			Essential shared libraries needed by /bin and /sbin
/media				Mount point for removable media (USB, CD-ROM)
/mnt				Temporary mount point for filesystems
/opt				Optional software packages
/srv				Data for services like FTP, HTTP, etc.

|-this command allow linux user to see the currently logged-in user.
|-The output displays the username of the effective user in the current shell.


pwd
|-print working directory

# To Make directory

mkdir <dir-name>

e.g:- mkdir aws

# To delete empty directory

rmdir <dir-name>

e.g: rmdir aws


# To list out all files & directories in present working directory

ls -l

# To move inside the directory(change directory)

cd <dir-name>

e.g: cd aws

cd ..



# Display current month calendar
cal

Note: if cal command not working then install ncal module
	sudo apt install ncal

# Display current date and time

exit



Linux File System
===================
|-In Linux everything is considered as file.

|-In Linux there are 3 different types of files

1.Regular File or ordinary files
2. Directory files
3.Special files or device files

1.Regular File or ordinary files
===================================

|- Ordinary files can contain text,data or program information.
|- An ordinary file can't contain another files, or directory.


2. Directory files
===================
|- We can described directories as containers that can hold files and other directorues.
|-Directory is group of files.
|-Directory is divided into two types

 - Root Directory
     |-Strictly speaking, there is only one root directory in your system which is denoted by /(forward slash)
     |-It is root of your entire file system and can not be renamed or deleted
 
-Sub directory
  |-Directory under root(/) directory is subdirectory which can be created,renamed by the user.


3.Special files or device files
================================
|- Special files represent input/output devices, like a tty(terminal), a disk drive, or a printer.







Creating New File:
=====================
|- We can create files by using two commands such as cat and touch.


touch command
==============
|-touch command can be used to create empty files.
|-By using touch we can create several empty files quickly, but by using touch we can't insert the data to the files.

# To create empty files

touch <filename>

e.g:- touch test1.txt

# To create multiple empty files

touch <filenam1> <filename2> <filename3>

e.g:- touch test2.txt test3.txt test4.txt


cat command
=============

# Create file with Content

cat > <file-name>

Note: After writing data press 'CTRL+ d' to save and close that file.

E.g: cat > test5.txt


# Show the file content (prin the file data)
cat <file-name>

E.g: cat test5.txt

# Append data to existing file

cat >> <file-name>

e.g: cat >> test6.txt

# To delete a file
rm <filename>

e.g: rm test1.txt

# To delete non-empty directories

rm -r <dirname>

Note:- 'r' represents recursive

e.g: rm -r aws


# Rename files & directories

mv <present-name> <new-name>


Copying Files:
================

|-There are many times when you will want to copy a file or directory.
|- cp command is used to copy a file.
|-The command name cp is an abbrevation for "copy"

# Copy data from one file to another file

cp source_file destination_fle

|-This creates a duplicate copy of source_file as destinationf_file
|-Both files will exist with same content

Copy File Content to Another File(using cat)
================================================
cat source.txt >destination.txt

|-Overwrites destination.txt with the content of source.txt
|- use >> instead of > to append instead of overwrite


cat source.txt >>destination.txt
