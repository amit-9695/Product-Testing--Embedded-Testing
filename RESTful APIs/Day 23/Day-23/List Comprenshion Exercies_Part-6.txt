Ques:-1
Find all of the words in a string that are less than 4 letters
sentence = 'On a summer day somner smith went simming in the sun and his red skin stung'

examine = sentence.split()

result = [word for word in examine if len(word) >=4]
print(result)


Que:-2
Produce a list of tuples consisting of only the matching numbers in these lists 
list_a = [1, 2, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
list_b = [2, 7, 1, 12].  
Result would look like (4,4), (12,12)

list_a = [1, 2, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
list_b = [2, 7, 1, 12]

result = [(a, b) for a in list_a for b in list_b if a == b]
print(result)

Que:-3
Given numbers = range(20), produce a list containing the word 'even' if a number in the numbers is even, and the word 'odd' if the number is odd.  
Result would look like ['odd','odd', 'even']

result = ['even' if n%2 == 0 else 'odd' for n in range(20)]
print(result)

Que:-4
Get only the numbers in a sentence like 'In 1984 there were 13 instances of a protest with over 1000 people attending'.  Result is a list of numbers like [3,4,5]

sentence = 'In 1984 there were 13 instances of a protest with over 1000 people attending'
words = sentence.split()
result = [number for number in words if not number.isalpha() ]
print(result)

Que-5
Find the common numbers in two lists (without using a tuple or set) 
list_a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list_b = [2, 3, 4, 5]

list_a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list_b = [2, 3, 4, 5]
common = [a for a in list_a if a in list_b]
print(common)

Que-6:
 Get the index and the value as a tuple for items in the list 
["hi", 4, 8.99, 'apple', ('t,b','n')]. 
Result would look like [(index, value), (index, value)]

items = ["hi", 4, 8.99, 'apple', ('t,b','n')]
result = [(index, item) for index, item in enumerate(items)]
print(result)


Que-7:
Create a list of all the consonants in the string "Yellow Yaks like yelling and yawning and yesturday they yodled while eating yuky yams"


sentence = "Yellow Yaks like yelling and yawning and yesturday they yodled while eating yuky yams"

result = [letter for letter in sentence if letter not in 'a,e,i,o,u, " "']

Que-8:
Count the number of spaces in a string

some_string = 'the slow solid squid swam sumptuously through the slimy swamp'
spaces = [s for s in some_string if s == ' ']
print(len(spaces))
