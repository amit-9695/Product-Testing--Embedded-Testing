Git Fetch
=========
|-When you are working on with other collaborators on a github repo.

|-One of your teamate has pushed up the changes to the master branch,but my local repo doesn't know!.

|-Then how do i get those changes??


|-This is where git fetch and git pull come into play.

|-git fetch and pull get those changes from the github repo to your local repo.


|-Fetching allows us to download changes from remote repository.
|-But those changes will not be integrated to our woring files.

|-It just lets you see what others have been working in, without merging those changes into your local repository

|-Just think of git fetch as link

Command for git fetch is
==========================
Git fetch <remote>

|-This command fetches branches and history from a specific remote repository.it only updates the remote tracking branches.

|-Git fetch origin would fetch all changes from the origin remote repository
|-if not specified remote it defaults to origin


|-We can also fetch a specific branch from a remote using the command

	git fetch <remote> <branch>

|-for example git fetch origin master would retrieve the latest information from the master branch on the origin remote repository

|-After fetching the changes. I will have those changes on my machine

|-But if i want to sess then i have to do the checkout to origin/master/

|-your local master branch will be untouched.
